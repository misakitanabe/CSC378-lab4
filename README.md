Your planet, Harmonia, has lost the sound of music! You play as Cadence, whose whole life is music. They decide to go on a quest to bring music and creativity back to the world. Use your arrow keys to move Cadence, use the letter keys Z through M to select piano notes, and press the space bar to shoot. So far, we only have one level built, but players can still experiment with the basic gameplay of Harmonia.
