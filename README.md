Your planet, Harmonia, has lost the sound of music! You play as Cadence, whose whole life is music. They decide to go on a quest to bring music and creativity back to the world. Use your arrow keys to move Cadence, and press the space bar to shoot. (Weâ€™re currently using a placeholder fireball sprite for the projectile, but will later replace that with a more interactive music-themed combat system.) So far, we only have one scene built, but players can still experiment with the basic gameplay of Harmonia.
